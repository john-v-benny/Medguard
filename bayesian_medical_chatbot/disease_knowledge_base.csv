AIDS,HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. HIV harms your immune system by destroying a type of white blood cell that helps your body fight infection. This puts you at risk for other infections and diseases. AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. It is the final stage of infection with HIV. It happens when the bodys immune system is badly damaged because of the virus. Not everyone with HIV develops AIDS. HIV is spread through certain body fluids from a person who has HIV. This can happen:,"The first signs of HIV infection may be flu-like symptoms: • Fever • Chills • Rash • Night sweats (heavy sweating during sleep) • Muscle aches • Sore throat • Fatigue • Swollen lymph nodes • Mouth ulcers These symptoms may come and go within two to four weeks. This stage is called acute HIV infection. If the infection is not treated, it becomes chronic HIV infection. Often, there are no symptoms during this stage. If it is not treated, eventually the virus will weaken your bodys immune system. Then the infection will progress to AIDS. This is the late stage of HIV infection. Because your immune system is badly damaged, your body cannot fight off other infections, called opportunistic infections (OIs). OIs are infections that happen more frequently or are more severe in people who have weakened immune systems. Some people may not feel sick during the earlier stages of HIV infection. So the only way to know for sure whether you have HIV is to get tested.",Information not available on MedlinePlus page.,"There is no cure for HIV infection, but it can be treated with medicines. This is called antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART can make HIV infection a manageable chronic condition. It also reduces the risk of spreading the virus to others. Most people with HIV live long and healthy lives if they get ART as soon as possible and stay on it. Its also important to take care of yourself. Making sure that you have the support you need, living a healthy lifestyle, and getting regular medical care can help youenjoy a better quality of life.","There is no cure for HIV infection, but it can be treated with medicines.",Information not available on MedlinePlus page.,"You can reduce the risk of getting or spreading HIV by: • Getting tested for HIV. • Choosing less risky sexual behaviors.

During this test, you inhale different concentrations of allergens or medicines that may tighten the muscles in your airways. Spirometry is done before and after the test. • Peak expiratory flow (PEF) tests to measure how fast you can blow air out using maximum effort • Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) tests to measure levels of nitric oxide in your breath when you breathe out. High levels of nitric oxide may mean that your lungs are inflamed. • Allergyskinorbloodtests, if you have a history of allergies.

Heart attack,"Each year almost 800,000 Americans have a heart attack. A heart attack happens when blood flow to the heart suddenly becomes blocked. Without the blood coming in, the heart cant get oxygen. If not treated quickly, the heart muscle begins to die. But if you do get quick treatment, you may be able to prevent or limit damage to the heart muscle. Thats why its important to know the symptoms of a heart attack and call 911 if you or someone else is having them. You should call, even if you are not sure that it is a heart attack. The most common symptoms in men and women are: You may also have other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and lightheadedness. You may break out in a cold sweat.

Hepatitis B,"Hepatitisis inflammation of theliver. Inflammation is swelling that happens when tissues of the body are injured or infected. It can damage your liver. This swelling and damage can affect how well your liver functions. Hepatitis B is a type of viral hepatitis. It can cause an acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term) infection. People with an acute infection usually get better on their own without treatment. Some people with chronic hepatitis B will need treatment. Thanks to a vaccine, hepatitis B is not very common in the United States. It is more common in certain parts of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia.","Often, people with hepatitis B dont have symptoms. Adults and children over 5 are more likely to have symptoms than younger children. Some people with acute hepatitis B have symptoms 2 to 5 months after infection. These symptoms can include: • Dark yellow urine • Diarrhea • Fatigue • Fever • Gray- or clay-colored stools • Joint pain • Loss of appetite • Nausea and/or vomiting • Abdominal pain • Yellowish eyes and skin, calledjaundice If you have chronic hepatitis B, you may not have symptoms until complications develop. This could be decades after you were infected. For this reason, hepatitis B screening is important, even if you have no symptoms. Screening means that you are tested for a disease even though you dont have symptoms. If you are at high risk, your health care provider may suggest screening.","Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus. The virus spreads through contact with blood, semen, or other body fluids from a person who has the virus. In rare cases, acute hepatitis B can cause liver failure. Chronic hepatitis B can develop into a serious disease that causes long-term health problems such ascirrhosis(scarring of the liver),liver cancer, and liver failure. If you have ever had hepatitis B, the virus may become active again, or reactivated, later in life. This could start to damage the liver and cause symptoms.","If you have acute hepatitis B, you probably dont need treatment. Some people with chronic hepatitis B dont need treatment. But if you have a chronic infection and blood tests show that hepatitis B could be damaging your liver, you may need to take antiviral medicines.","But if you have a chronic infection and blood tests show that hepatitis B could be damaging your liver, you may need to take antiviral medicines.","To diagnose hepatitis B, your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: • A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms • A physical exam • Blood tests, includingtests for viral hepatitis","The best way to prevent hepatitis B is to get the hepatitis B vaccine.

Hyperthyroidism,"Hyperthyroidism, or overactive thyroid, happens when yourthyroidgland makes more thyroid hormones than your body needs. Your thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck. It makes hormones that control the way the body uses energy. These hormones affect nearly every organ in your body and control many of your bodys most important functions. For example, they affect your breathing, heart rate, weight, digestion, and moods. If not treated, hyperthyroidism can cause serious problems with your heart, bones, muscles, menstrual cycle, and fertility. But there are treatments that can help. Hyperthyroidism has several causes. They include:","The symptoms of hyperthyroidism can vary from person to person and may include: • Nervousness or irritability • Fatigue • Muscle weakness • Trouble tolerating heat • Trouble sleeping • Tremor, usually in your hands • Rapid andirregular heartbeat • Frequent bowel movements ordiarrhea • Weight loss • Mood swings • Goiter, an enlarged thyroid that may cause your neck to look swollen. Sometimes it can cause trouble with breathing or swallowing. Adults over age 60 may have different symptoms than younger adults. For example, they may lose their appetite or withdraw from other people. Sometimes this can be mistaken fordepressionordementia.","Hyperthyroidism has several causes. They include: • Graves disease, an autoimmune disorder in which your immune system attacks your thyroid and causes it to make too much hormone. This is the most common cause. • Thyroid nodules, which are growths on your thyroid. They are usually benign (not cancer). But they may become overactive and make too much thyroid hormone. Thyroid nodules are more common in older adults. • Thyroiditis, inflammation of the thyroid. It causes stored thyroid hormone to leak out of your thyroid gland. • Too much iodine. Iodine is found in some medicines, cough syrups, seaweed and seaweed-based supplements. Taking too much of them can cause your thyroid to make too much thyroid hormone. • Too much thyroid medicine. This can happen if people who take thyroid hormone medicine forhypothyroidism(underactive thyroid) take too much of it. If hyperthyroidism isnt treated, it can cause some serious health problems, including: • An irregular heartbeat that can lead toblood clots,stroke,heart failure, and otherheart problems • An eye disease called Graves ophthalmopathy. It can cause double vision, light sensitivity, and eye pain. In rare cases, it can lead tovision loss. • Thinning bones andosteoporosis • Fertility problems in women • Complications in pregnancy,such aspremature birth,low birth weight,high blood pressure in pregnancy, andmiscarriage","The treatments for hyperthyroidism include medicines, radioiodine therapy, and thyroid surgery: • Medicinesfor hyperthyroidism includeAntithyroid medicines, which cause your thyroid to make less thyroid hormone. You probably need to take the medicines for 1 to 2 years. In some cases, you might need to take the medicines for several years. This is the simplest treatment, but it is often not a permanent cure.Beta blocker medicines, which can reduce symptoms such as tremors, rapid heartbeat, and nervousness. They work quickly and can help you feel better until other treatments take effect. • Antithyroid medicines, which cause your thyroid to make less thyroid hormone. You probably need to take the medicines for 1 to 2 years. In some cases, you might need to take the medicines for several years. This is the simplest treatment, but it is often not a permanent cure. • Beta blocker medicines, which can reduce symptoms such as tremors, rapid heartbeat, and nervousness. They work quickly and can help you feel better until other treatments take effect. • Radioiodine therapyis a common and effective treatment for hyperthyroidism. It involves taking radioactive iodine by mouth as a capsule or liquid. This slowly destroys the cells of the thyroid gland that produce thyroid hormone. It does not affect other body tissues. Almost everyone who has radioactive iodine treatment later develops hypothyroidism. This is because the thyroid hormone-producing cells have been destroyed. But hypothyroidism is easier to treat and causes fewer long-term health problems than hyperthyroidism. • Surgeryto remove part or most of the thyroid gland is done in rare cases. It might be an option for people with large goiters or pregnant women who cannot take antithyroid medicines. If you have all of your thyroid removed, you will need to take thyroid medicines for the rest of your life. Some people who have part of their thyroid removed also need to take medicines. If you have hyperthyroidism, its important not to get too much iodine. Talk to your health care provider about which foods, supplements, and medicines you need to avoid.

Hypoglycemia,"Blood glucose, or blood sugar, is the main sugar found in your blood. It is your bodys primary source of energy. It comes from the food you eat. Your body breaks down most of that food into glucose and releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood glucose goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to be used for energy. For people withdiabetes, your body doesnt make enough insulin, cant use it as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesnt reach your cells. Hypoglycemia means low glucose. It happens when the level of glucose in your blood drops below what is healthy for you:","The symptoms of low blood glucose tend to come on quickly. The symptoms can be different for everyone, but they may include: • Shaking • Sweating • Nervousness or anxiety • Irritability or confusion • Dizziness • Hunger","Hypoglycemia is common in people who havediabetes type 1or who havediabetes type 2and take insulin or otherdiabetes medicines. It can happen: • As a side effect of insulin or some other medicines that help your pancreas release insulin into your blood. These medicines can lower your blood glucose level. • If you dont eat or drink enoughcarbohydrates(carbs). Carbs are the main source of glucose for your body. • If you get a lot more physical activity than usual. • If you drink too much alcohol without enough food. • When you are sick and cant eat enough food or keep food down. Although its rare, you can still get low blood glucose without having diabetes. The causes can include conditions such asliver disease,kidney disease, andhormonedeficiencies (lack of certain hormones). It can also happen in people who have had certain types ofweight loss surgery. Some medicines, such as certain heart medicines andantibiotics, can also cause it. See your health care provider to find out the cause of your low blood glucose and how to treat it.","If you have mild or moderate hypoglycemia, eating or drinking something with carbohydrates can help. But severe hypoglycemia can cause serious complications, including passing out, coma, or even death. Severe hypoglycemia can be treated with glucagon, a hormone that raises blood glucose levels. It can be given as nasal spray or injection. If you have diabetes, your provider can prescribe you a glucagon kit for use in case of an emergency. If you have diabetes and you often have mild or moderate low blood glucose, your health care team may make changes to yourdiabetes meal plan, physical activity plan, and/or diabetes medicines. If you dont have diabetes and you keep having low blood glucose, the treatment will depend on what is causing it to happen.","If you have diabetes and you often have mild or moderate low blood glucose, your health care team may make changes to yourdiabetes meal plan, physical activity plan, and/or diabetes medicines.","If you have diabetes, youll most likely need to check your blood glucose every day and make sure that its not too low. You can do this with a blood glucose meter or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. There are alsoblood teststhat providers can use to check if your blood glucose is too low. If you dont have diabetes and you have hypoglycemia, your provider will likely order other tests to try to figure out the cause.","If you have diabetes and you take insulin or other medicines that lower blood glucose, you can help prevent hypoglycemia if you: • Follow your diabetes meal plan. Eat and drink enough carbs to keep your blood glucose in your target range. Also carry a source of fast-acting carbohydrate, such as glucose tablets or a juice box, with you in case your blood glucose gets too low. • Be safe during physical activity. Check your blood glucose before and afterwards.

It can also slow the babysgrowth and development.","The treatment for hypothyroidism is medicine to replace the hormone that your own thyroid can no longer make. About 6 to 8 weeks after you start taking the medicine, you will get a blood test to check your thyroid hormone level. Your health care provider will adjust your dose if needed. Each time your dose is adjusted, youll have another blood test. Once you find the right dose, you will probably get a blood test in 6 months. After that, you will need the test once a year. If you take your medicine according to the instructions, you usually should be able to control the hypothyroidism.

Osteoarthristis,"Osteoarthritis, sometimes called OA, is a type ofarthritisthat only affects the joints, usually in the hands, knees, hips, neck, and lower back. Its the most common type of arthritis. In a healthy joint, the ends of the bones are covered with a smooth, slippery tissue called cartilage. The cartilage pads the bones and helps them glide easily when you move the joint. With osteoarthritis, the cartilage breaks down and becomes rough. Sometimes, all the cartilage wears away and the bones rub together. Bumps of extra bone called bone spurs may grow in the joint area. There is no cure for osteoarthritis. It usually gets worse slowly. But theres a lot you can do to manage the symptoms.","Osteoarthritis affects people in different ways, and not everyone has pain. The most common symptoms are: • Pain when you move, which often gets better with rest • Stiffness, especially for the first 30 minutes after you get up from resting • Swollen joints, especially after using the joint a lot • Less movement in the joint than normal • A joint that feels loose or unstable",Researchers arent sure what causes osteoarthritis.

Paralysis (brain hemorrhage),"A stroke happens when there is a loss of blood flow to part of the brain. Your brain cells cannot get the oxygen and nutrients they need from blood, and they start to die within a few minutes. This can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death. If you think that you or someone else is having a stroke, call 911 right away. Immediate treatment may save someones life and increase the chances for successful rehabilitation and recovery. There are two types of stroke:","The symptoms of a stroke often happen quickly. They include: • Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg (especially on one side of the body) • Sudden confusion, trouble speaking, or understanding speech • Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes • Sudden difficulty walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination • Sudden severe headache with no known cause The F.A.S.T. test can help you remember what to look for if you think someone is having a stroke. Think FAST and look for: • Face drooping on one side when smiling. • Arm weakness occurs when the arms are raised, and one arm drifts downward. • Speech is slurred or strange. • Time to call 911. If you think that you or someone else is having a stroke, call 911 right away. Every minute counts during a stroke.",Information not available on MedlinePlus page.,"Treatments for stroke include medicines, surgery, and rehabilitation. Which treatments you get depend on the type of stroke and the stage of treatment. The different stages are: • Acute treatment, to try to stop a stroke while it is happening • Post-stroke rehabilitation, to overcome the disabilities caused by the stroke • Prevention, to prevent a first stroke or, if you have already had one, prevent another stroke Acute treatments for ischemic stroke are usually medicines: • You may get tPA, (tissue plasminogen activator), a medicine to dissolve the blood clot. You can only get this medicine within 4 hours of when your symptoms started. The sooner you can get it, the better your chance of recovery. • If you cannot get that medicine, you may get medicine that helps stop platelets from clumping together to form blood clots. Or you may get ablood thinnerto keep existing clots from getting bigger. • If you have carotid artery disease, you may also need a procedure to open your blocked carotid artery. Acute treatments for hemorrhagic stroke focus on stopping the bleeding. The first step is to find the cause of bleeding in the brain. The next step is to control it: • If high blood pressure is the cause of bleeding, you may be givenblood pressure medicines. • If ananeurysmis the cause, you may need aneurysm clipping or coil embolization. These are surgeries to prevent further leaking of blood from the aneurysm. It also can help prevent the aneurysm from bursting again. • If anarteriovenous malformation(AVM) is the cause of a stroke, you may need an AVM repair. An AVM is a tangle of faulty arteries and veins that can rupture within the brain. An AVM repair may be done through • Surgery • Injecting a substance into the blood vessels of the AVM to block blood flow • Radiation to shrink the blood vessels of the AVM Stroke rehabilitationcan help you relearn skills you lost because of the damage. The goal is to help you become as independent as possible and to have the best possible quality of life. Prevention of another stroke is also important, since having a stroke increases the risk of getting another one. Prevention may include heart-healthy lifestyle changes and medicines.","Treatments for stroke include medicines, surgery, and rehabilitation.

The pain: Peptic ulcers happen when the acids that help you digest food damage the walls of the stomach or duodenum. The most common cause is infection with a bacterium calledHelicobacter pylori. Another cause is the long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) such as aspirin and ibuprofen. Stress and spicy foods do not cause ulcers, but can make them worse. To see if you have an H. pylori infection, your doctor will test your blood, breath, or stool.

Pneumonia,"Pneumonia is an infection in one or both of your lungs. It causes the air sacs of your lungs to fill up with fluid or pus. Pneumonia can range from mild to severe, depending on what caused it, your age, and your overall health. Bacterial,viral, andfungalinfections can cause pneumonia. Bacteriaare the most common cause. Bacterial pneumonia can occur on its own. It can also develop after youve had certain viral infections such as acoldor theflu. Several different types of bacteria can cause pneumonia, including:","The symptoms of pneumonia can range from mild to severe and include: • Fever • Chills • Cough, usually with phlegm (a type of thick mucus made in your lungs) • Shortness of breath • Chest painwhen you breathe or cough • Nausea and/or vomiting • Diarrhea The symptoms can vary for different groups. Newborns and infants may not show any signs of the infection. Others may vomit and have a fever and cough. They might seem sick, with no energy, or be restless. Older adults and people who have serious illnesses or weak immune systems may have fewer and milder symptoms. They may even have a lower-than-normal temperature. Older adults who have pneumonia sometimes may feel weak or suddenly get confused.","Bacterial,viral, andfungalinfections can cause pneumonia. Bacteriaare the most common cause. Bacterial pneumonia can occur on its own. It can also develop after youve had certain viral infections such as acoldor theflu. Several different types of bacteria can cause pneumonia, including: • Streptococcus pneumoniae • Legionella pneumophila; this type of pneumonia is often calledLegionnaires disease • Mycoplasma pneumoniae • Chlamydia pneumoniae • Haemophilus influenzaetype b (Hib) Virusesthat infect the respiratory tract may cause pneumonia. Viral pneumonia is often mild and goes away on its own within a few weeks. But sometimes it is serious enough that you need to get treatment in a hospital. If you have viral pneumonia, you are at risk of also getting bacterial pneumonia. The different viruses that can cause pneumonia include: • Respiratory syncytial virus(RSV) • Some commoncoldandfluviruses • SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causesCOVID-19 Fungalpneumonia is more common in people who have chronic health problems orweakened immune systems. Some of the types include: • Pneumocystispneumonia(PCP) • Valley fever(Coccidioidomycosis) • Histoplasmosis • Cryptococcal pneumonia Aspiration can also cause pneumonia. It can happen when you aspirate (accidentally breathe in) food or fluid into the lungs. If you are not able to cough out the food or fluid, it may cause an infection. Sometimes pneumonia can cause serious complications such as: • Bacteremia, which happens when the bacteria move into the bloodstream. It is serious and can lead toseptic shock. • Lungabscesses, which are collections of pus in cavities of the lungs. • Pleural disorders, which are conditions that affect the pleura. The pleura is the tissue that covers the outside of the lungs and lines the inside of your chest cavity. • Kidney failure. • Respiratory failure.","Treatment for pneumonia depends on the type of pneumonia, which germ is causing it, and how severe it is: • Antibioticstreat bacterial pneumonia and some types of fungal pneumonia. They do not work for viral pneumonia. • In some cases, your provider may prescribe antiviral medicines for viral pneumonia. • Antifungal medicines treat other types of fungal pneumonia. You may need to be treated in a hospital if your symptoms are severe or if you are at risk for complications. While there, you may get additional treatments. For example, if your blood oxygen level is low, you may receiveoxygen therapy. It may take time to recover from pneumonia. Some people feel better within a week. For other people, it can take a month or more.","Treatment for pneumonia depends on the type of pneumonia, which germ is causing it, and how severe it is: • Antibioticstreat bacterial pneumonia and some types of fungal pneumonia. • In some cases, your provider may prescribe antiviral medicines for viral pneumonia. • Antifungal medicines treat other types of fungal pneumonia.","Sometimes pneumonia can be hard to diagnose.

You usually get the patches on your elbows, knees, scalp, back, face, palms and feet, but they can show up on other parts of your body. Some people who have psoriasis also get a form of arthritis calledpsoriatic arthritis. A problem with your immune system causes psoriasis. In a process called cell turnover, skin cells that grow deep in your skin rise to the surface. Normally, this takes a month. In psoriasis, it happens in just days because your cells rise too fast.

Not everyone infected with TB bacteria (germs) becomes sick. So, there are two types of TB conditions: TB is found in the U.S., but it is more common in certain other countries.","Most people who have TB germs in their bodies dont get sick with TB disease. Instead, they have inactive TB infection. With an inactive TB infection, you: • Dont have symptoms • Cant spread TB to others • Could get sick with active TB disease in the future if your immune system becomes weak for another reason • Need to take medicine to prevent getting sick with active TB disease in the future If you have TB disease, the TB germs are active, meaning that they are growing (multiplying) inside your body and making you sick. If the TB is growing in your lungs or throat, you can spread the TB germs to other people. You can get sick with TB disease weeks to years after youre infected with TB germs. With TB disease, your symptoms will depend on where the TB is growing in your body: • General symptoms may include:Chills andfeverNight sweats (heavy sweating during sleep)Losing weight without tryingLoss of appetiteWeakness orfatigue • Chills andfever • Night sweats (heavy sweating during sleep) • Losing weight without trying • Loss of appetite • Weakness orfatigue • Symptoms from TB disease in your lungs may include:Acoughthat lasts longer than 3 weeksCoughing up blood or sputum (a thick mucus from the lungs)Chest pain • Acoughthat lasts longer than 3 weeks • Coughing up blood or sputum (a thick mucus from the lungs) • Chest pain","TB is caused by bacteria (germs) calledMycobacterium tuberculosis. The germs spread from person to person through the air. People who have TB disease in their throat or lungs spread the germs in the air when they cough, sneeze, talk, or sing. If you breathe in the air that has the germs, you can get TB. TB is not spread by touching, kissing, or sharing food or dishes. Youre more likely to catch TB from people you live or work with than from people you see for shorter amounts of time.","The treatment for both inactive TB infection and TB disease is antibiotics. To make sure you get rid of all the TB germs in your body, its very important to follow the directions for taking your medicine. If you dont follow the directions, the TB germs in your body could change and becomeantibiotic resistant. That means the medicine may stop working and your TB may become hard to cure. • For inactive TB infections, you need to take medicines for three, four, six, or nine months, depending on the treatment plan. Treatment helps make sure you dont get TB disease in the future. • For active TB disease, you usually need to take medicines for four, six, or nine months, depending on the treatment plan. Treatment will almost always cure you if you take your pills the right way. • For TB disease in your lungs or throat, youll need to stay home for a few weeks, so you dont spread disease to other people. You can protect the people you live with by:Covering your nose and mouth.Opening windows when possible.Not getting too close to them. • Covering your nose and mouth. • Opening windows when possible. • Not getting too close to them. • For drug-resistant TB disease,which means that the TB germs are resistant to certain TB medicines, you will need to take special medicines.
